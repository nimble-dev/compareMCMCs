#' Rename an MCMC method throughout a list of `MCMCresult` objects
#' 
#' This is useful because an MCMC method name appears in multiple places
#' 
#' @param MCMCresult One or a named list of `MCMCresult` objects, such a returned by
#' \code{\link{compareMCMCs}}.
#' 
#' @param newName A new (replacement) name for one of the MCMC method names
#' 
#' @param oldName An old (existing) name for one of the MCMC method names
#' 
#' @details
#' This replaces the MCMC label `oldName` with `newName` anywhere they appear in 
#' the `MCMCresult` list.  This includes in various places in the `metrics` elements of
#' the `MCMCresult` objects.
#' 
#' If `oldName` is omitted, `MCMCresult` must be a single `MCMCresult` object, in which 
#' the existing MCMC method name will be replaced by `newName`.  Hence `oldName` is only 
#' necessary if `MCMCresult` is a list of `MCMCresult` objects.
